# Personal Finance Tracker

The aim of this project is to allow the user to add transactions and view that data either tabularly or visusally.

User is given a list of options to enter
1. Add transaction
2. View transaction summary within a date range
3. View spending trends
4. Exit

After user chooses their option, the program will request more information depending on what the user chooses (Ex. Ask for valid transaction data, what duration to view tabular data, which visuals to view). The program will also deny invalid information and request users to retry.


### Future Updates
- Give user the option to cancel if they no longer want to add a transaction
- Add legend to show sub-category totals in charts

- Create a website and app to deploy the program to
